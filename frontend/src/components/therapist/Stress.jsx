                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Stress is the body’s reaction to any change that it experiences, which requires an adjustment or response. The body reacts to these changes with physical, mental, and emotional responses. The word 'stress' is quite often used in a negative sense.

                        But stress isn't always bad and it is a normal part of life. In fact, sometimes stress can be positive and can spur one to be productive, creative, prepared for challenges, and stay motivated and focused. But too much stress or prolonged stress can impact our physical and mental health. It can bring on – or worsen – certain symptoms or diseases. Common side effects of stress on the body range from aches and pains, sleep-related issues, nausea and dizziness to anxious or racing thoughts, moodiness, and even irritability and short temper.

                        When does stress become a matter of concern? When it becomes overwhelming and starts affecting your health, your productivity, your relationships, and the overall quality of your life. There are physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms of stress. Being aware of these can help you understand what you are going through and deal with it accordingly.

                        A person can feel stress anytime a situation is seen as threatening, challenging and difficult to cope with. An extremely busy lifestyle with multiple responsibilities, aspirations, competition, coupled with poor nutrition and sleep, lack of relaxation, inadequate exercise, increased use of smartphones, and being confined indoors can increase the risk of stress.
